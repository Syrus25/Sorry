        <h1>Dear Arzoo ,</h1>
        <p>"There's something special about having a friend like you, ArzooðŸ’—ðŸ’—. Maybe it's the way we just click, how we
            can laugh about anything (even that time with the sprinklers!) and still talk for hours about things that
            matterðŸ’—ðŸ’—. We haven't known each other for ages, but in just a few months, you've become someone I can truly
            count on. You're always there to listen, support me, and celebrate my victories, big and small. I know I can
            be myself around you, no judgment, no masks. Thanks for being you, Arzoo. Here's to many more memories
            together!"
        <p>Your Best Frnd Shorya ðŸ’—ðŸ’— </p>
