        <h1>Dear Didi (Divya)</h1>
        <p> I hope this message finds you well. I've been reflecting on our friendship, and I realize that there have
            been moments where I may have let you down or caused any distress. I want you to know how truly sorry I am
            for any misunderstandings or mistakes that may have come between us. Our talks as frnds  hold a special
            place in my heart, and I cherish the connection we share.
            Life is a journey filled with ups and downs, and I regret if my actions have added any unnecessary bumps
            along the way. I value our friendship immensely, and the last thing I want is for anything to hinder the
            bond we've built over time. I genuinely apologize for any hurt I may have unintentionally caused.
            I also want you to know that I completely understand and respect your choices, including your connection
            with Saad. If you choose to explore that path, I want you to be happy, and I genuinely have no problem with
            it. Your happiness is important to me, and I support whatever brings joy into your life.
            Let's not let these hiccups define our relationship. I miss our conversations and the unique dynamic we have
            as frnds . Your friendship means a lot to me, Wishing you nothing but joy and happiness, and looking forward to more heartfelt talks and shared moments as
            Didi Bhai. Thank you for your understanding, 
            Sorry and warm regards,
            Shorya
